We will be cruising through the following topics
- What is tailwind? (Recap)
- What did I build?
- Time 
- Custom additions to `tailwind.js`

## What is tailwind? (Recap)
Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override. I have taken this definition from [here](https://tailwindcss.com/).

The documentation is stunning, I personally finished reading documentation.

## What did I build?
After a good success with replication of [youtube](https://dev.to/gillarohith/i-replicated-youtube-design-using-tailwind-css-dmc). So I decided to replicate [Dev to](https://de.to/). It was close enough I feel. It‚Äôs only the desktop version of the website.

### Progress
- Phase 1
As I always prefer, I start with the _layout_.

## Custom additions to `tailwind.js`
This are the custom colors used in the development process.
```json
dev: {
        gray: "#1a2634",
        body: "#0d1219",
        text: "#f9fafa",
        link: "#dde0e2",
        teal: "#1CB3A6",
        tealPri: "#26d9ca",
        hoverTags: "#868EE7",
        searchBox: "#2E3A48",
      }
```
